**Question: My self-published book has been out for a couple of months, and I just checked my sales dashboards in Amazon and Smashwords. So far it hasn’t sold a single copy. Is this a sign I should give up? The longer it’s on the store without selling, the more it's just going to get pushed to the back of the pile, right?**

No, it's not a sign you should give up. More on that later.

## Books do not sell without promotion

First, though, let's look at an important truth about self-publishing, and its corresponding misconception.

The truth is:

> A self-published book won't sell a single copy just by being on the stores. **If you don't tell people about your book, you will sell zero copies.**

And the misconception is:

> By self-publishing and getting my book on the stores, I will sell copies without doing any marketing.

If you haven't sold any copies, the first question to ask yourself is, *what have I done to let people know about my work?*

Even if the answer is some version of "something", if you aren't satisfied with your sales results, you still have work to do.

## Send an email to (almost) everyone in your list

The most important thing you can do is tell everyone you know about your book by email.

Go into your email client or webmail program, and any contact or address book apps you have, and export all your contacts as an XLS or CSV. Open those files in Excel or [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/) and delete all the people you *don't* want to tell or annoy.

Remove these addresses:

* Customer support and "noreply@" email addresses
* Bosses, clients, co-workers, members of your family, and partners or ex-partners—anyone who might have an issue with the content (esp. if your work has autobiographical and/or sexual content).

### Services to use

I recommend signing up for an account at [TinyLetter](http://tinyletter.com/) to send your emails. TinyLetter appears to allow uploading your entire contact list, and so it’s a good starting point. There are also few options for sending messages, so you are unlikely to get confused. TinyLetter will allow you to import the addresses that you exported in the previous step.

Later on, you should switch to [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/), which has a lot more options and features for people making serious use of email marketing. 

The key thing here is that you *can’t* just upload your contact list to MailChimp. If you do, the high proportion of bounces and unsubscribes on your first email will get you instantly and permanently banned.

You should move on to MailChimp only after you've sent a few emails and you're no longer getting many unsubscribes or bounces from each one.

### What should I say?

Your email to your contacts should be conversational, just like the sort of email that you'd usually write to a friend. It needs to mention that your book is out and where people can get it, but it shouldn't be overly salesy. 

Explain what the book is about, but don't make big claims about how great it is or how it's going to change readers' lives. If you've shown the book around a little already, you can use quotes from readers to illustrate that others have already enjoyed it.

Here's an example of the sort of message you could send:

> Hi, everyone,
> 
> It might be a while since you've heard from me (or maybe not!), so I hope you'll forgive me for sending you an email out the blue to share some important news.
>
> I recently published my first novel, [Kiss Me, Genius Boy](http://www.amazon.com/Kiss-Genius-More-Dreams-Book-ebook/dp/B005NH7AJO/). 
>
> Very briefly, the book is the first in a three-part series that tells the story of Joshua Rivers, a young man who meets the woman he once dreamed he was destined to marry, discovers she's married to an old friend, and resolves to take her away from him. It's also the story of Josh's beachside childhood, his nymphomaniac lover Lily, and an intellectual exploration of the perils of living for the vision of a perfect life or world to come.

You could skip the next bit, which I can include only because I already have feedback, but it shows the importance of getting readers on-board with your project early.

> Early readers have compared the book to work by J.D. Salinger (*The Catcher in the Rye*, Stephen Chbosky (*The Perks of Being a Wallflower*), Michel Houellebecq, (*Atomize*, *Platform*) and Karl Ove Knausgaard (*My Struggle*). Here are some of their comments:
> 
> *"A page turner, very funny and unusually honest and frank … Lily really steals the show. A nymphomaniacal exploiter of men and women, a deeply interesting, entertaining and wild character who lights up every page she is on." —Nicola G.*
> 
> *"Just read Berko scene from KMGB. Kick ASS! That scene just earned me buying vol 2 when it comes out. Lily needs a cape and skin-tight leather pants. Lily needs her own graphic novel. Lily should be immortal, and probably is. Read KMGB so you can meet Lily. I secretly think she is Joshua's alter-ego. I think she might now also be mine." —Esme F.*
> 
> *"Uniquely refreshing … particularly erotic in its unabashed candidness." —Madeline R.*

But do make sure you include something like this.

> I probably don't need to say that having put a book out for the first time is a huge deal for me, and if you have the chance to check it out, I really hope you'll enjoy it as much as these readers have. Here's where you can get it as an e-book:

> One thing I should tell you about: there is some explicit sexual content in the book, so if that's not for you—well, just watch out. It may reassure you to know that it's all part of a conscious strategy that explores the contemporary popularity of shock art. Also, some readers have really enjoyed those scenes.
>
> If you do have the time to read the book and enjoy it, I'd really appreciate it if you leave a review on Amazon, Goodreads, or your favorite retailer. Reviews are absolutely essential for independently published authors like myself, and they help us out immeasurably. You could also just send me an email to [ben@hourigan.co]("mailto:ben@hourigan.co") and let me know your thoughts. Sharing in readers' experiences is one of the things authors live for.
> 
> Finally, I'm already working on the sequel, and I'll be sure to let you know when it’s out. I might also write from time to time with other news about writing and what I've been up to. Feel free to write back to me, too—I'd love to hear your news.
>
> Happy reading!

## Then get 10–20 reviews

If you have a few hundred people in your list, you should get some sales. People will read it, and a small number will review it. Others will tell you in person what they thought, or write you an email.

Your next job is going to be to chase those people who had opinions but didn't write a review—*and get them to write those reviews*.

This bit *is* going to feel a bit like door-to-door sales. You'll feel like you're pestering people, and you will be. But these people care about you and your work—after all, they took the time to read your book and to tell you about it. All you'll be doing is trying to overcome their tendency to procrastinate by helping them understand how important this is to you.

Why are these initial purchases and reviews so important? Here are some reasons:

* The more people buy your book, the more chances it will have to appear in "also bought" recommendations on retailers—it may even hit a bestseller list. It's only at this point, when *some* people already know about your book, that you will begin to get ambient exposure on the storefronts.
* Good reviews show potential readers that your book is good, and give them a social reason to buy. 
* Average review scores can also be used as a way to order searches on some stores (i.e. Amazon). 
* Good reviews also open avenues to paid promotion. If you want to be successful, you should be willing to put up some money for advertising.

Ultimately, your goal should be to work through the excellent 10-point list by David Gaughran in his article [Starting from Zero](https://davidgaughran.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/starting-from-zero/).

It all begins with getting reviews…

## Should you give up?

…and it ends with "Don't give up."

So, no—you shouldn't give up. Successful independent authors are fond of saying that e-books have an infinite shelf-life. Unlike traditional print books, they won't be pulled off the shelves if they don't sell right away. A marketing campaign, an unexpected piece of publicity, or the release of your next book could all be the catalyst for shooting your current book into the bestseller lists.

It may not happen today, but if your book is good enough, if you are diligent in promoting it, and if you keep writing new books to tell people about, your book could become a bestseller in months, years, or even decades from now. 

But it will never happen if you give up. If your writing is important to you—and I mean, *intrinsically important*, not just because it seems to promise riches, fame, and freedom—don't ever give up.
