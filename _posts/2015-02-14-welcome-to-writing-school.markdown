*Welcome to Writing School. You probably have a few questions.

# What is *Writing School*?

Writing School is a place to learn about writing:

* how to start
* how to get better
* how to strive for greatness

We all have different ideas about what greatness might be. For me, it means achieving the same standard and renown as some of my favorite or most admired authors, such as Ernest Hemingway, Ursula Le Guin, Milan Kundera, Charles Bukowski, and Kenzaburô Oe.

# Who are you?

I’m [Ben Hourigan](http://benhourigan.com), an Australian novelist and editor living in Bangkok.

My two books are [Kiss Me, Genius Boy](http://benhourigan.com/writing/kiss-me-genius-boy) and [My Generation’s Lament](http://benhourigan.com/writing/my-generations-lament).

I’ve been a freelance and in-house editor for more than ten years, and I currently work full-time in my own consultancy, [Hourigan & Co.](http://hourigan.co) Most of my work involves:

* editing and producing print and electronic books for self-publishing authors
* editing marketing copy, reports, and white papers for small and large businesses
* advertising copywriting
* web development for authors and small businesses, mostly using WordPress

# How do I learn about writing?

That’s a good question. There are multiple approaches to writing and to learning how to write. Here, I hope to cover a wide range of topics, based on my own experience as a novelist and self-publisher, the discussions I have with my fellow writers and editors, and the questions my clients raise.

One of the things I’ve noticed over the past few years, and particularly since I’ve been freelancing full time, is that learning to be a good writer, and eventually a great one, is a task that divides into quite different areas. For now I’m calling these *the four pillars of writing*.

# The four pillars of writing

## 1. Preparation

The first pillar, *preparation*, is often neglected in today’s world of nigh-instantaneous self-publishing. Stories of overnight success from self-published authors have led to the impression that there’s a publishing gold-rush on—and some people have, accordingly, rushed into the business of writing.

When we talk about the preparation beginning and established writers need to do, here, we’ll be looking at things like:

* The lifelong work of being an avid reader. What should you read? How should you read it? And why? How much do you need to read before you’re ready to write?
* Learning the fundamentals of grammar and style, then moving on to become a great prose stylist.
* Understanding how story structure works, and learning to identify and develop compelling plots and characters. What are the established formulas for good storytelling? How much should you cleave to them and what are the best ways to diverge and keep your work original, individual, and fresh?
* Researching the factual background behind what you write.
* Developing a worldview that gives you something worthwhile to say. Should your work be political? How much? Is there a didactic element to your work, or are you all about aesthetics? What’s your personal philosophy, and how does it come into your work? Are you offering your readers insight and wisdom? What kind of self-development will help you be a better writer?

## 2. Process

*Process* is what you’re immersed in when you’re at your keyboard and writing. When we look at process, we’ll be talking about things like:

* The best tools (often, the best *software*) to write with
* Techniques for planning and organizing your work.
* Time management and increasing your productivity.
* How to maximize the quantity and quality of your output.
* What is great writing? How do you improve your writing style and develop your personal voice? How can you create better metaphors and imagery, or write better characters and dialog?

## 3. Publishing

Writing is at its most valuable when it’s done for others. Your work’s destiny is not, ideally, to lie unread on your hard drive or in your bottom drawer, but to give pleasure and inspiration to millions.

It’s 2015, and over the past decade publishing has become massively different. Ten years ago, we might not have covered self-publishing as part of the third pillar, but now it’s a major feature.

When we talk about publishing, we’ll look at:

* submitting your manuscript to agents and publishers for traditional publication
* how to make electronic and print books for self-publication
* how to self-publish—to get your work onto major retailers and in front of potential readers

## 4. Promotion

The advent of self-publishing means that hundreds of thousands of new works are now published every year. Many are substandard and not worth a reader’s time. Lets assume your work is great and deserves a wide audience. Getting readers to pay attention is your most difficult task. This is what we talk about when we talk about *promotion*:

* how to sell your books
* using email marketing tools, websites, and social media to connect with readers
* promoting your books with paid advertising

Contrary to what you might expect, promotion can be the most difficult of the three pillars to master. Even after you've spent years preparing, mastering your craft, and then writing a masterpiece, you still may struggle to build an audience, sell your work, and make a living from what you most want to do.

How do I make myself a bestseller? I don’t have a foolproof plan to offer—but I’m doing my best to find one, and you’ll be the first to know when I do.

# What is Writing School built on, and why?

**Actually, this site right here is on Jekyll, but the real site, at [blog.writingschool.org](http://blog.writingschool.org), runs on Ghost just as described.**

Writing School, or at least this blog, is currently built with [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), a relatively new blogging platform written in server-side JavaScript. It’s hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://ghost.org/), which is a simple, quick, and cheap way to deploy new sites if you have a bit of technical know-how.

I’ve chosen Ghost partly because it’s one of the most exciting web-publishing platforms at the moment, and I love trying out new stuff for myself and my clients.

But there are other, non-technical reasons, too. I’ve been using WordPress for more than a decade, and it’s served me well. In that time, it’s evolved into an enormously capable CMS that’s my tool of choice for building websites that my author and small-business clients can administer themselves if they want to.

Yet WordPress’s power has brought with it a complexity that discourages writing. I blog less than I used to, partly because I’m busy and partly because I don’t feel like WordPress is the right tool any more. Ghost might be what I’ve been looking for.

As part of the second pillar of writing, “process”, Writing School will introduce you to some of the best tools available to facilitate your writing. One of those tools is [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/), a super-simple way of writing in plain text that can work almost anywhere, helps you write well-structured manuscripts, and opens up a huge array of possibilities for converting your work into high-quality print and electronic formats.

With Ghost, you write in Markdown, which is one of the things that makes it great. If you’re new to blogging, Ghost is a great place to get started and learn about Markdown at the same time. [Check it out](https://ghost.org/), and stay posted here for more content.

# The first rule of Writing School

The first rule of Writing School is you *do* talk about Writing School. Follow us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/writingschoolWS) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/writingschoolWS).

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
