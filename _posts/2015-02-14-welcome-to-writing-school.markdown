Welcome to Writing School. You probably have a few questions.

# What is *Writing School*?

Writing School is a place to learn about writing:

* how to start
* how to get better
* how to strive for greatness

We all have different ideas about what greatness might be. For me, it means achieving the same standard and renown as some of my favorite or most admired authors, such as Ernest Hemingway, Ursula Le Guin, Milan Kundera, Charles Bukowski, and Kenzaburô Oe.

# Who are you?

I'm [Ben Hourigan](http://benhourigan.com), an Australian novelist and editor living in Bangkok. 

My two books are [Kiss Me, Genius Boy](http://benhourigan.com/writing/kiss-me-genius-boy) and [My Generation’s Lament](http://benhourigan.com/writing/my-generations-lament).

I've been a freelance and in-house editor 

# How do I learn about writing?

That's a good question. There are multiple approaches to writing and to learning how to write. Here, I hope

…

The four pillars:

1. Preparation
2. Process
3. Publishing
4. Promotion

# What is Writing School built on?

Writing School is built with [Jekyll](htt)

<!-- You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll’s dedicated Help repository][jekyll-help].
